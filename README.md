Hi   
I'm retired and probably doing stuff with models and electronics that maybe should have been done 50yrs ago but family and money had priorities.

I find reading instructions easier to follow as some video contect is tooooo fast and breif.

there is some amazing designs on this site and also Ardunio along with the 3 d printing sites, Well done to you all you give me inspiration.
